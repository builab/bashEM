# bashEM

A library of, almost exclusively, shell scripts written in Bash that are useful for image processing workflows in cryo-EM.

Heavily developed in environments utilising Relion, Eman2, cryoSPARC, Frealign etc.

These do represent a substantial amount of time invested to develop and troubleshoot. If you find these scripts useful, then please acknowledge appropriately.

Have fun!
